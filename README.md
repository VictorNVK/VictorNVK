## About me🟢
        I am young developer from Russia. Now, my main/favorite language is java
        But, also i want learn other language, python, js(node.js), kotlin(maybe lol)
        
### Why programming?       
    Idk, maybe because I love to create something. And because I can get money for my creations(Only good ones)
    I doesn`t like make useless pet project. I think if your code is not useful - you are a bad developer
